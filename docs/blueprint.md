## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) for neutral tone, which acts as a subtle interface against a background.
- Background color: Almost-white (#FAFAFA) for a light and airy background, providing contrast against the primary.
- Accent color: Pale gray (#D0D0D0) used sparingly, particularly for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear and modern readability throughout the site.
- Maintain a simple, consistent grid structure with plenty of whitespace to promote a minimalist feel.
- Employ a set of minimal icons, possibly as monochromatic line drawings.
- Incorporate subtle transitions to highlight interactive UI components, providing a sense of interactivity.
